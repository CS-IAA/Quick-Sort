# Quick-Sort

A Java program that implements a QuickSort algorithm. Implements functions that sort an array using in-place quicksort and pivot selection with the first element as the pivot, a random element as the pivot, the median of three random elements as the pivot, and the median of the first, middle, and last element as the pivot. Each sorting method is timed and recorded. The integers come from a function that generates random numbers based on the provided amount.
